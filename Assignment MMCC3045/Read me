I tested in both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. They both seemed to work.

However, in the dribble minigames, the player runs faster in Chrome than in Firefox. As a result please dribble slowly when reaching at the goal because it sometimes does not pick up the goal line (Chrome only).

I apologize for any bugs or missing code that I did not catch.

To win: Pick at least one rest early before Japan/Italy match. Do not fail at any of the mini games.

To succeed in the shoot/pass minigame
Japan - Middle or Right
Italy - Player
Germany1 - Left
Germany2 - Right
